# Portfolio Website

For the Final HTML and CSS assignment I created a Portfolio Website utilizing
* JavaScript
    * To create the responsive Contact Form that will open and close on a click. 
    * To create the functionality for the Slide Show
* HTML
* CSS
    * To create the styling effects.
        * Hover effects
        * Slide in animations
        * Fade Effects
        * Smooth Scrolling

To create a simple streamline Portfolio to display my personality, style, and skills. This project was a culmination of all of my practice from the Web_Project files.
